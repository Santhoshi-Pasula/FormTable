        <h1>virtual dom</h1>
        <p>The Virtual DOM is a crucial concept utilized in modern frameworks such as React, which significantly
            improves the performance of updating the real DOM. When a state change occurs in a React component, instead
            of updating the actual DOM directly, React creates a
            lightweight replica of the DOM known as the Virtual DOM</p>
